Then launch it. A white chat window will open.

Normally, Ollama will launch automatically when you start your computer.

2. Download an Ollama model

If you have a fast internet connection and at least 8GB RAM then I suggest you download
the gemma3:4b model (3.3GB).
This model can handle both text and images.
If you have a slow connection then download the smaller gemma3:270m model (292MB).
This model can handle text only.

How to download a model:
Open the Ollama desktop app.
Paste the model name (e.g. gemma3:270m) into the dropdown in the bottom right.
Type any message e.g. Hi.
The model will start to auto download.
